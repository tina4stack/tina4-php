# Changelog

Tina4 keeps ONE version across all four frameworks (Python, PHP, Ruby, Node.js), so a version
number means the same thing everywhere.

**The authoritative release notes for every shipped version live in the documentation:**
https://tina4.com/php/36-releases

This file is deliberately NOT a copy of those notes. Duplicating them is exactly how a
changelog rots into claiming a version that was never cut, so this file records only
UNRELEASED work. When a version ships, its notes go to the release notes above.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **MQTT 3.1.1 client** (`Tina4\Mqtt` / `Tina4\MqttMessage`), zero-dependency (PHP streams +
  `ext-openssl`), verified against a real broker with no mocks. Publish/subscribe/consume, QoS 0/1,
  retained, Last Will, per-stream TLS, QoS 2 refused loudly. Takes the family to **98 built-in
  features**.

### Changed

- **Breaking: `\Tina4\SqlTranslation` is renamed to `\Tina4\SQLTranslator`.**
  The SQL dialect-translation class was the only one of the four frameworks not called
  `SQLTranslator` (Python, Ruby and Node.js all already used that name), drifting on both the
  acronym casing and the noun. PHP is now aligned. PSR-4 means the file moved too:
  `Tina4/SqlTranslation.php` -> `Tina4/SQLTranslator.php`.

  **Migration:** replace `\Tina4\SqlTranslation` with `\Tina4\SQLTranslator`. Method names and
  behaviour are unchanged. There is deliberately NO compatibility alias - the project rule is
  to rename the primary rather than accumulate shims.

## Earlier history (pre-3.x)

Kept for reference only. Everything from 3.x onward is in the release notes linked above.
Note: the 2.0.99 entry below was duplicated in this file with overlapping content; the two
copies have been merged into the single entry that reflects what actually shipped.
