# DokuWiki Template Ad-Hominem

A clean and lightweight HTML5 template for DokuWiki

## Features

  * Developed from and extending the original DokuWiki template
  * Cleaned up the HTML5 and CSS code
  * Reduced overhead: small and fast download times!

## Localizations

As the template uses only the original DokuWiki template strings, it should work with any of the languages that DokuWiki comes in.
  
## Work in Progress

This is a "work in progress". For most of you this is not a template you want to use in a production system as it is now.
