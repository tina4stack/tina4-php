Tina4 is a lightweight routing and templating system which allows you to write websites and API applications very quickly.
This is not another framework. Keep things simple and efficient. Tina4 is perfect if you want to build a website, run a CMS, create APIs or if you want to learn a structured PHP framework.

Tina uses the following methods to make development quicker:

* [[https://www.php.net/downloads.php|PHP 7.3 or greater]] built in web server
\\
* [[https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/)|Twig]] Templating - no configuration needed
\\
* [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification|OpenAPi]] & [[https://swagger.io/|Swagger]] annotated routes for  UI
\\
* Simple code layout and [[tina4:introduction:directories|directory structure]]
