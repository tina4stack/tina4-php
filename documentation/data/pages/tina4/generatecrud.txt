====== Generate Crud Routes ======
Tina4 has a unique way to generate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete|CRUD]] routes for you for use in your API.

Let me show you how I create an API route for a Users ORM class.

Create an ORM Class for your Table first if you have not done so yet.

==== Step 1 - Create file  ====

To start out create a file in your routes/api directory.

* In this example I want to make a route that responds to /api/user
\\ 
* I want to get data from the Users ORM object I created. 

<code php /routes/api/user/index.php>
<?php

(new User())->generateCRUD("/api/user/");
//   ^                       ^  
// Your ORM object          Desired API Endpoint

</code>

==== Step 2 - Spin-up Web-Server  ====

Now for the fun part 8-). Execute your code by visiting your site. 

In your Browser URL address bar go to:
<code url>
http://localhost:(your_port_number)
</code>

<WRAP center round tip>
Make sure you hit a route that does not get served from cache or this won't work.
</WRAP>

==== Step 3 - Go back and do what you require  ====

Return to the file and you'll find Get, Post, Delete ... API routes already written for your ORM Object. You can customize and enjoy :)
