====== Create a table/migration ======
Need to create a table for the database?

To create a table also known as creating a migration, simple follow these steps: 

===== Step 1 - Spin up Web Server =====
In your IDE command terminal use this command to spin up a Web Server: 
\\
<code bash>
composer start
</code>

Once you have the Web Server running, you will be able to access your website through your broswer.
\\
===== Step 2 - Creating your migration =====
In your URL address bar:
<code url>
localhost:(your_port_number)/migrate/create
</code>

It will take you to a window where you will be able to create your table with the fields you want.

Here you will create your SQL script which will create the table in your database.

It will look something like this:
\\
\\
{{  :migrate.png?nolink&center  }}

===== Step 3 - Run your migration =====
In your browsers URL, hit up /migrate for all your tables to be added to the [[tina4:database|database]].

In your URL address bar:
<code url>
locahost:(your_port_number)/migrate
</code>

A script will run and insert the tables you created in [[tina4:migrations|migrations]], to your database.
