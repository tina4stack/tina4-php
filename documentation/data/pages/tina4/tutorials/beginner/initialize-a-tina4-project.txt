====== Initialize a Tina4 project ======
If you have just installed Tina4 with composer then you run this command in your IDE terminal:
<code bash>
   composer exec tina4 initialize:run
</code>

Please note, this adds the necessary scripts to your composer.json file and will NOT work if you already have and index.php file. It will also create a **secrets** folder in your project repo which has they security keys used in Tina4.
