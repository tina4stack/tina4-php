====== Posting form data ======
When creating a form for a user to complete, we use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)|POST]] method to secure the data that is sent to  a server/database. 

You need a form key to post to a Tina4 Post route. This is easy to add to into your [[https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/|Twig]] or [[https://html.com|HTML]] form:
<code twig>
<form action="/post-route" method="POST">
   <button>Submit</button>
   {{ "reason for token" | formToken | raw }}
</form>
</code>   
   
In code the token is also available as :
<code php>
<?php

$_SESSION["tina4:authToken"]   
</code>   
   
You can define how long a token lasts in your [[tina4:env|env]] file:
<code env>
TINA4_TOKEN_MINUTES=5
