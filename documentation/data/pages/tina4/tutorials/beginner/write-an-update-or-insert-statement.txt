====== Writing an update or insert statement ======

Tina4 uses [[tina4:orm|ORM(Object-Relational Mapping)]] to do most of the heavy lifting for you, on an object extending \Tina4\ORM, the save method handles the insert or update. 

<code php>
<?php

   global $DBA;
   
   $DBA->exec ("update my_table set my_name = ?, phone = ?", "Name", "Phone");
   $DBA->commit(); //based on the database you use
</code>

Here you can see that we executed an update statement to insert a statement to the database.
