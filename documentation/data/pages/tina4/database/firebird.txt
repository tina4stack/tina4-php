====== Connecting to Firebird ======


The database connection is established in a global variable called **$DBA** in the index.php file for convenience, you could put it anywhere as long as it is global and required before any database functionality is required. For testing purpose, you can use the SQLite database type below.

<WRAP center round info 100%>
For a custom database hostname and port use the following format in your ENV file:
<code env>
DB_NAME=10.248.228.22/3306:databasename
</code>
</WRAP>

===== Examples: =====
Notice the convention of using the hostname:[database|database-path] except when it is SQLite which then becomes the local path.

==== For Firebird database type: ====

<code php>
<?php

global $DBA;

//Firebird 
$DBA = new \Tina4\DataFirebird("localhost:/home/database/FIREBIRD.DB", "sysdba", "masterkey");
</code>
