====== Migrations in Tina4 ======
===== Create a table/migration =====
Want to create a table for your database? Migrations are sequential [[https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/statements_1001.htm|SQL statements]] which keep track of your [[tina4:database|database]] changes.  We recommend using migrations especially when you want to apply changes to a running system or when working in a team.

Each time you run a migration, it will generate all the tables required for your database

**Windows**
   c:\projectfolder\migrations\
**Linux**
   /home/username/Documents/projectfolder/migrations

**Start up the built in web service** 
<code bash>
   composer start
</code>
Click on the following link to create a migration for your project

<WRAP center round info>
**Default Url**
http://localhost:7145/migrate
</WRAP>

  * On this screen you can enter a description for your migration and then type in the SQL you want to run
  * SQL statements should be separated by a ";"
  * If you write a stored procedure or trigger then only one of those statements is allowed per migration
  * You will be shown that the migration was created and a SQL file with the table you just created will be in the migration folder.

Migrations will be run every time you hit up the /migrate route of your project.
