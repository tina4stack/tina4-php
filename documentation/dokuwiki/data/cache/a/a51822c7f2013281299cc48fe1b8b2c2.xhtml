If you want to adjust the logo, simply use the Media Manager to upload a <code>logo.png</code> into the <code>wiki</code> or the root namespace and it
will be automatically used. You can also upload a <code>favicon.ico</code> there. If you use a closed
wiki it is recommended to make the <code>wiki</code> (or root) namespace world readable in the <abbr title="Access Control List">ACL</abbr> settings or
your logo is not shown to not logged in users.
