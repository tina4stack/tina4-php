<p>
The <a class="link-external link-combo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" rel="noopener" target="target=_blank">ORM</a> in Tina4 tries to be as light as possible on coding, the basic form uses the object name to map to the table and assumes the first public variable you declare is the primary key.
</p>

<p>
It is required to extend the <strong>\Tina4\ORM</strong> class to make the magic happen.
