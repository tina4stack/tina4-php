This <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/popularity" class="interwiki iw_doku" title="https://www.dokuwiki.org/popularity">tool</a> gathers anonymous data about your wiki and allows you to send it back to the DokuWiki developers. This helps them to understand them how DokuWiki is used by its users and makes sure future development decisions are backed up by real world usage statistics.
</p>

<p>
You are encouraged to repeat this step from time to time to keep developers informed when your wiki grows. Your repeated data sets will be identified by an anonymous ID.
</p>

<p>
Data collected contains information like your DokuWiki version, the number and size of your pages and files, installed plugins and information about your PHP install.
</p>

<p>
The raw data that will be send is shown below. Please use the “Send Data” button to transfer the information.
