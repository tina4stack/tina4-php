====== Installation ======

The recommended way to install PHP on Mac is with the brew package manager

Follow the instructions https://brew.sh/ to install brew

Then execute the following:
<code bash>
brew install php@7.4
</code>   

===== Docker =====

Running on a Mac with an M1 chip may cause issues if you want to run all the PHP extensions as some may not be compatible. Docker is a solution here.
<code bash>
brew install --cask docker
</code>
