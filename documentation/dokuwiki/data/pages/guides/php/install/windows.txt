Once the files have been extracted, you will need to go into the folder and create a configuration file.

Configure the "php.ini" file: 

  - Go to the folder where you extracted PHP. 
  - Rename file named "php.ini-development" to "php.ini".
  - Open php.ini file by opening it with Notepad or IDE tool 

Find the following extensions and remove the semicolon in front of the word extension:

    ;extension=curl
    ;extension=fileinfo
    ;extension=gd2
    ;extension=intl
    ;extension=mbstring
    ;extension=openssl
    ;extension=pdo_mysql
    ;extension=shmop
    ;extension=soap
    ;extension=sqlite3
    ;extension=tidy
    ;extension=xmlrpc
    ;extension=xsl
    
Press Ctrl+S or save changes you just made to "php.ini" file.

===== Step 3 - Edit environment path variable =====
