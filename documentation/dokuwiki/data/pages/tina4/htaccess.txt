====== HTACCESS ======

When installing Tina4 and run the initialize command you will notice that a **.htaccess** file was created into your project directory.

===== What is HTACCESS? =====

An **.htaccess** is a distribution configuration file. The abbreviation means Hypertext Access file. It allows you set dependencies in your project so the configuration you setup which is applied throughout the project.

===== Why HTACCESS? =====

We make use of the **.htaccess** file if we are using what is known as shared hosting, thus the **.htaccess** file allows us to make changes and protocols when connecting to a server.

You can have more than one **.htaccess**

===== What can HTACCESS be used for? =====
<WRAP center info>
 * Customize error pages
 \\
 * Redirects
 \\
 * Setting HTTP headers
 \\
 * Redirect User based on IP
 \\
 * Error page customization
 \\
 * Including MIME types
</WRAP>

**Example:**
<code htaccess .htaccess>
DirectoryIndex index.php
RewriteEngine On
# Some hosts may require you to use the `RewriteBase` directive.
# If you need to use the `RewriteBase` directive, it should be the
# absolute physical path to the directory that contains this htaccess file.

#Block access to .env and other files
<Files ~ ".env">
Order Allow,Deny
Deny from all
Satisfy all
</Files>

<Files ~ "^.*\.([Hh][Tt][Aa])">
Order allow,deny
Deny from all
Satisfy all
</Files>

#Disable the 3 lines below for just to http
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/.well-known/.*$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301,NE]


RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]

#Add ability to get the authorization headers on the webserver
SetEnvIf Authorization .+ HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$0
</code>

Another reason is that the **.htaccess** file allows you to edit runa webpages configuration, without the need to edit server configuration files.
