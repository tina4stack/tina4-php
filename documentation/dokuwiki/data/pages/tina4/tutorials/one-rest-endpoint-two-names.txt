====== Use the same REST end point with two different names ======
We really hate to write too much code, thus a **|** will separate the different end points, so we don't have to create a separate route/path in the script. 

Here's an example:

<code php>
<?php
\Tina4\Get::add("/hello/world|/hello/wrld", function(\Tina4\Response $response, \Tina4\Request $request){  
    return $response("Hello World", HTTP_OK, TEXT_HTML);
});
