====== Connecting to a database ======
Tina4 currently supports 3 database types which are:

* [[https://firebirdsql.org/en/firebird-rdbms/|Firebird]]
\\
* [[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/|MySQL]]
\\
* [[https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html|SQLite]]

The database connection is established in a global variable called **$DBA** in the **index.php** file for convenience, you could put it anywhere as long as it is global and required before any database functionality is required.

=== Connecting to SQLite3 ===

The simplest connection to configure is **SQLite3** database type:

<code php>
<?php 

global $DBA;

//SQLite
$DBA = new \Tina4\DataSQLite3("test.db");
</code>

=== Connecting to MySQL ===

This is how to configure your database connection using **MySQL** database type: 

<code php>
<?php

global $DBA;

//MySQL
$DBA = new \Tina4\DataMySQL("localhost:somedatabase", DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, "d/m/Y");
</code>

This is how to configure your database connection using **FireBird** database type: 

<code php>
<?php

global $DBA;

//Firebird 
$DBA = new \Tina4\DataFirebird("localhost:/home/database/FIREBIRD.DB", "sysdba", "masterkey");
</code>
