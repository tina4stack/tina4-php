====== Let my class use the database ======
You will build **classes** to define your objects, routes, variables etc. A class will have your functions and variables in it. We call these functions and variables **objects**. 

A class can be a collection of objects which has different behaviors and properties. For example, you may want to extend your class so that it connects to your database. 

Extend your class with **\Tina4\Data**:
<code php>
<?php

   class MyClass extends \Tina4\Data {
      
      function doSomething() {
         $records = $this->DBA->select ()->from("someTable")->asArray();
         return $records;
      }  
   }
 </code>

Above you will see an example of building a class where you link to the database, specify the required fields and make it return the values as an array.
