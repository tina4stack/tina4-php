====== Create a basic route ======
Every time an User  goes to a link or new page, this can be referred to as they are being directed to a path. With Tina4, creating a route is as easy as naming your route path and including a $response and $request variable as your various functions.

The route on the default config **http://localhost:7145/starthere** would be coded as below.

<code php>
<?php
  \Tina4\Get::add("/starthere", 
  function(\Tina4\Response $response, \Tina4\Request $request)
  {
      // Put all the code that you want to here
      return $response("Hello Mars");
  });
</code>

The Router object is designed to work with the Response object. It is highly recommended to include the Response object in every route.

Below are some of the other features available with Routes.

===== Route methods =====
__This is one way to add Get route with Tina 4.__
<code php>
<?php
\Tina4\Get::add("/yourstuff", 
function(\Tina4\Response $response, \Tina4\Request $request)
{
    // Put all the code that you want to here
    return $response("Hello Mars");
});
</code>

__This is one way to add Post route with Tina 4.__
<code php>
<?php
\Tina4\Post::add("/yourstuff", 
function(\Tina4\Response $response, \Tina4\Request $request)
{
    // Put all the code that you want to here
    return $response("Hello Mars");
});
</code>

Numerous Route methods are available, based around the common API routing methods such as [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET|GET]], [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST|POST]], etc. 

===== Including variables =====

There are three different ways to include variables in Routes, in which the inclusion of the \Tina4\Request & \Tina4\Repsonse object is required. 

===== Securing Routes =====

Routes can easily be secured to take advantage of the Tina4\Auth object.

Another method of securing your Routes is annotating them with the "@secure" tag:
<code php>
<?php
/**
*@secure
**/
<!-- Your Code Here -->
</code>
