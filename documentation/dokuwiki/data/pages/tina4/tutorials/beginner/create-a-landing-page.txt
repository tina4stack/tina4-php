====== Create a basic landing page ======
Creating a website has just been made much easier with Tina 4! As an example try the below steps and see how simple it is. 

In your **src/templates** folder create a twig file called index.twig

Add the HTML elements you wish to see on your page (e.g):
<code twig>
   <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</code>

To see what you just created, spin up a web server and run Tina4:
<code bash>
    composer start
</code>

<WRAP center round important 100%>
Make sure **TINA4_DEBUG=true** in your .env file to disable caching.
</WRAP>
