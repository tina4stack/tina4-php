====== Filter Database for an entry ======
Lets say you want to filter the database for all the entries with the first name "Peter". In your SQL tool that you are using, you can query a record or it can be done in the IDE Terminal. Here's an example:

<code php>
<?php
\Tina4\Get::add("/player/names", function ($names, \Tina4\Response $response, \Tina4\Request $request) {
$names = (new UserName())->select("*") //-->the table you want to select. It has to be is accordance with the Helper.
                         ->where (names = Peter) //-->the filter you want 
                         ->asArray;
 return $response (\Tina4\renderTemplate("yourtemplate.twig", ["names" => $names, ), HTTP_OK, TEXT_HTML);
});
