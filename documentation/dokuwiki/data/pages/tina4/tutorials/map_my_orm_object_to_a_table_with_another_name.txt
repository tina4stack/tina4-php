====== Map my ORM object to a table with another name ======
If you require to extend or map your ORM object to a database field which doesn't follow the Tina4 pattern, take a look at the example below:

<code php>
<?php

class User extends \Tina4\ORM { //assumes we have a table user in the database
    public $tableName="my_weird_database_table"; //will make sure this object gets data to and from this table    
    public $id; //primary key because it is first
    public $name; //some additional data
}
