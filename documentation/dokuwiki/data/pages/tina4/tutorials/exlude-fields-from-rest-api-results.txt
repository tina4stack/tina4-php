====== Exclude some fields from being displayed on REST result or query ======
Lets say you want to exclude a field from the database. Using SQL statements in your script, you can exclude a record. 

Here's an example:

<code php>
<?php

class User extends \Tina4\ORM { //assumes we have a table user in the database
    public $id; //primary key because it is first
    public $name; //some additional data
    public $excludeFields = "password,myId"; //fields that must be excluded
}   

class OtherUser extends \Tina4\ORM { //assumes we have a table user in the database
    public $id; //primary key because it is first
    public $name; //some additional data
    public $excludeFields = ["password","myId"];
}
