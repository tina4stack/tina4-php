====== Tina4 & Custom Authentication ======
Tina4 makes use of OpenSLL to assist with various security **$requests** and **$responses**. You can make use to this by adding  **{ { "tokenName" | formToken | raw } }**  within your form tokens. This way you can ensure data between users and the servers are secure. 

This security method ensures that the Clients **token** authenticates them on a Server, allowing them to continue on your webpage. This is done to avoid any data risk or breaches as the information between the User and the Server is confidential and important.

This method checks that the token, exact time-stamps and time-zones are exactly accurate to gain access to the Server/Database.
