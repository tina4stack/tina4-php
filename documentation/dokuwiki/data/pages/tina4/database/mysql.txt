====== Connecting to Mysql ====== 
The database connection is established in a global variable called **$DBA** in the index.php file for convenience, you could put it anywhere as long as it is global and required before any database functionality is required. 

To install the MySQL driver for your system simply run this command in your terminal:

<code bash sqldriver.bash>
composer require tina4stack/tina4php-mysql
</code>

==== For MySQL database type: ====

<file php>
<?php

global $DBA;

//MySQL
$DBA = new \Tina4\DataMySQL(
    "localhost:somedatabase", 
    DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, 
    "d/m/Y");
</file>

For a custom database hostname and port use the following format in your ENV file:
<code env>
DB_NAME=10.248.228.22/3306:databasename
</code>
</WRAP>

Note the Date Format which should be in your localized format. Tina4 will transpile your dates for you depending on your Database Engine's preferred date format.
