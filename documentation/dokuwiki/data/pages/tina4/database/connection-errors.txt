====== Errors while connecting to the Database ======

You may have seen that in Tina4, if we require a Database, which is included via the **index.php** located in project root via the :

<code php>
<?php

require "vendor/autoload.php";

global $DBA;

//MySQL
$DBA = new \Tina4\DataMySQL(
   https://tina4.com/documentation/doku.php?id=playground:playground "localhost:somedatabase",
    DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD,
    "d/m/Y");
    
 echo new \Tina4\Tina4Php();
</code> 

==== What errors you may expect? ====

If you experience any trouble connecting to the DB you can try troubleshoot the following:
\\
1. Ensure that you have the Database native app installed on your device
\\
2. Ensure the correct Database type is being used for your project requirements
\\
3. Ensure the Database version is compatible with SQL, IDE and other tools. 
\\
4. Ensure you have all the Tina4 prerequisites installed correctly
