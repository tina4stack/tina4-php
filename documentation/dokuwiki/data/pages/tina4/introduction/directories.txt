====== Tina4 Directory Structure ======

As you know by now Tina4 is not a Framework. There are some general conventions we used to make things more consistent. You can use all parts of Tina4 or only some parts. 

What makes Tina4 different from Frameworks you may have used is how compact its code base is. Tina also has quick ways of doing things like generating ORM Objects from your database.

<WRAP center round tip>
Each folder in a new Tina4 project has a README file that explains what part of Tina4 class you should extend. i.e. \Tina4\Process
