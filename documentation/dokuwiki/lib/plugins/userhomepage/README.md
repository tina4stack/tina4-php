User HomePage
============

Dokuwiki plugin to automatically create user's homepage and/or namespace (see [public page](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:userhomepage) for more details).
Previous authors stopped developing it in 2009.
I started to work on it in 2014-08.

## Live demo is up !
A [live demo website](http://demo.geekitude.fr/) is available. Simply log in as **demo** (same string for password) and play around.

The content is resetted every hour and any Github update is applied with a maximum delay of one hour.
