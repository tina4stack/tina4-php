So if you read the P\+HP vs \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_tina4}{Tina4}} P\+HP article, you will realise I am still quite new to all this. I have finally figured out that the {\bfseries{Postman}}, was actually delivering the correct {\bfseries{package}} from the {\bfseries{Composer}} to {\bfseries{Tina}}. There was actually nothing wrong with her {\bfseries{Windows}}, just had to {\bfseries{push}} and {\bfseries{pull}} a bit, some {\bfseries{Git}} installed it badly.

Previously most of my development was in a grown up text editor, so an Integrated Development Environment (I\+DE) was a new concept to me. If like me, you are a little lost, and I\+DE focuses on the \textquotesingle{}integrated\textquotesingle{}. A place where you can see all your development files for a project, which automatically looks after version control, sharing development with others, debugging, a terminal window for command line executions, code autocomplete, and code analysis. As I said I am new to this, so I am sure there are some other gems that I am missing, but have seen enough to understand this is really worth it. It also has allows me to write this documentation in {\bfseries{Markdown}}.

It is important to note that there are a number of I\+DE Software packages, different places you can host your Git repositories and different P\+HP debugging engines. This choice is absolutely no endorsement of the software, it was merely what was suggested to me. So this is how to setup {\bfseries{Php\+Storm}} on {\bfseries{Windows}}, with {\bfseries{X\+Debug}} and {\bfseries{Git}} integration.\hypertarget{md_documentation_ide-environment-setup_autotoc_md43}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{md_documentation_ide-environment-setup_autotoc_md43}
Firstly head over to Jet\+Brains to download a \href{https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/\#section=windows}{\texttt{ 30 day trial of Php\+Storm}}. Just follow the install prompts like normal software. Easy enough.

Git is a two part installation. Installing the Git software on your machine and then finding a place to host your code repositories. \href{https://git-scm.com/download/win}{\texttt{ Download the 64bit Windows version of Git}} to install the software. Then head over to Git\+Hub and \href{https://github.com/}{\texttt{ sign up a free account with them}}, which should be enough to get developing and hosting your repositories.

\href{https://xdebug.org/download}{\texttt{ Download the Xdebug Windows compiled binary}} and copy the .dll file into your php/ext folder and modify your php.\+ini file by including the following text.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[xdebug]}
\DoxyCodeLine{zend\_extension = c:\(\backslash\)php\(\backslash\)ext\(\backslash\)php\_xdebug-\/2.9.3-\/7.4-\/vc15-\/x86\_64.dll}
\DoxyCodeLine{xdebug.remote\_enable=1}
\DoxyCodeLine{xdebug.remote\_port="{}9000"{}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Save the php.\+ini file, restart Php\+Storm, and Xdebug is running. To check it is working type {\ttfamily php -\/v} in the terminal command line. You should get something like this back, showing the Xdebug library is installed.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{PHP 7.4.3 (cli) (built: Feb 18 2020 17:29:46) ( ZTS Visual C++ 2017 x64 )}
\DoxyCodeLine{   Copyright (c) The PHP Group}
\DoxyCodeLine{   Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies}
\DoxyCodeLine{       with Xdebug v2.9.3, Copyright (c) 2002-\/2020, by Derick Rethans}
\end{DoxyCode}

So that is all the software installed. So when starting your first project you will need to integrate both Git and Xdebug into your project. Luckily this can all be found in the Php\+Storm menu system.

File$>$New Project$>$Select a Folder$>$ will create a new project in the folder of your choice.

V\+CS$>$Import into Version Control$>$Create Git Repository$>$Select folder for respository$>$ I always use the root of the folder. A version control Tab will now be available at the bottom of your Php\+Storm window.

File$>$Settings$>$Languages and Frameworks$>$P\+HP$>$Choose the Language version of your P\+HP$>$ This might be project specific, but best to use the correct version of P\+HP that you are running.

File$>$Settings$>$Languages and Frameworks$>$P\+HP$>$Choose the C\+LI Interpreter$>$ For the first time that you are doing this, there are no recognised interpreters. Click the . . . next to the dropdown. Click + to add a new interpreter, and hopefully it has already found the php engine {\ttfamily c\+:\textbackslash{}php\textbackslash{}php.\+exe} presuming that is where you installed your P\+H\+P.\+Select all the OK\textquotesingle{}s and you should be good to go.

You use the Listen / Don\textquotesingle{}t Listen button that looks like a phone to turn debugging on or off when running code.

Your I\+DE is now setup for developing, using Git Version control and with a debugger available to assist with tracing your coding errors.\hypertarget{md_documentation_ide-environment-setup_autotoc_md45}{}\doxysubsection{Optimization}\label{md_documentation_ide-environment-setup_autotoc_md45}
Each time you push a commit to your Git\+Hub repository you might not want to send all of it. For example if you are using \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_tina4}{Tina4}}, you do not want to commit that to your repository, as you should not be working on that code, and it will update from time to time. This will apply to any other libraries that you have included. Right click the folder you want to exclude from Git pushes$>$Git$>$Add to .gitignore$>$ It might create the .gitignore file if it does not exist in your project. Any folders greyed out in Php\+Storm will not committed to your repository.

Setting the C\+LI interpreter should probably be set as a default to get this working on each new project that you create. Again using the menus File$>$Other Settings$>$Settings for new projects$>$Languages and Frameworks$>$P\+HP$>$ and set it up as above. The difference is that for each new project this will now be set as default.
