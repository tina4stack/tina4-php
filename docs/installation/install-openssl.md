# Install OpenSSL

## Introduction
 
A toolkit used for Security Layer protocols between a computer network and Internet servers. Follow these instructions to install OpenSSL on your system. 

### For Windows

#### Step 1 - Download & Install

Head to the Shining Light Productions page and download the current stable version for your Operating System. In this case we are using a x64bit Windows. 

Here's the link : [Shining Light Productions](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)

After the download is complete, run the installation file and follow the prompts carefully. The installation window will inform you once the installation is complete. 

#### Step 2 - Edit environment path variable 

After you have installed OpenSSL, you must add the OpenSSL bin folder in your systems environment variable table.

Add path environment variable:
 
``` 
Open Control Panel
Go to System
Go to Advanced system settings
```
     
<div align="center" alt="Add Path Environment Variable 1">

</div>        

``` 
Go to Environment variable 
Look for "Path" in the "Variable" column and click Edit.
```
     
<div align="center" alt="Add Path Environment Variable 2">

</div>

``` 
Click on Browse, locate the "bin" folder directory where you installed OpenSSL (e.g. C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin). 
Click OK and then click Ok again to close the "Edit environment variable" window. 
```

#### Step 3 - Confirm installation        

Complete the installation by restarting your system so that changes may take effect.After this you can confirm if the installation was a success by opening your command terminal (e.g Command Prompt or terminal in your IDE tool) and typing in "openssl version" and pushing Enter. This will display the OpenSSL version if installed correctly. If you receive an error, the installation was unsuccessful. In this case, uninstall OpenSSL and follow the steps again.
