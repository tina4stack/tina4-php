### Step 2 - Copy and configure PHP 

Unpack/Extract the zip file or content into a file named "php" on the main drive on your system. 

```

Once the files have been extracted, you will need to go into the folder and edit the configuration settings file. 

Configure "php.ini" file: 

```
Go to the folder where you extracted PHP. 
Delete file named "php.ini". 
Rename file named "php.ini-development" to "php.ini".
Open php.ini file by opening it with Notepad or IDE tool 
```

    <img src="images/config1.png">
</div>

```
Find the following extensions and remove the semicolon infront of the word extension:
    ;extension_dir = "ext"
    ;extension=curl
    ;extension=fileinfo
    ;extension=gd2
    ;extension=intl
    ;extension=mbstring
    ;extension=openssl
    ;extension=pdo_mysql
    ;extension=shmop
    ;extension=soap
    ;extension=sqlite3
    ;extension=tidy
